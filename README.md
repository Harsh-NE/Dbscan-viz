**DBSCAN Clustering Visualization:**
This project visualizes the DBSCAN clustering algorithm using OpenCV by generating a video that illustrates the clustering process frame-by-frame. Each data point is plotted, and as the algorithm runs:

Points unassigned to a cluster remain black

Points are colored when they are added to a cluster

The current point being examined is surrounded by a gray hollow circle with radius equal to epsilon
